@BillGates,Businessman,Four billion people are at risk from mosquito-borne diseases. We can get that number down to zero if we invest in new tools — like a set of techniques for genetically modifying mosquitoes — to complement the ones we already have.
@BillGates,Businessman,I learned a lot from Washington State Teacher of the Year @_MrHand about creating a classroom where kids want to be (and he taught me how to make BBQ chicken).
@BillGates,Businessman,"Melinda and I are big fans of @DonorsChoose, and we were thrilled to learn that @WKamauBell is, too. Today, when you support teachers as they prepare to go back to school, your donation will get a 50% boost from our foundation"
@BillGates,Businessman,"When teachers have the right tools, there’s no telling where it will take them. Today, when you give to @DonorsChoose, @gatesfoundation will boost your donation by 50%. I hope you’ll join us in supporting teachers"
@BillGates,Businessman,Being poor isn’t cheap. It’s hundreds of times more expensive to use charging stations than it is to charge a phone at home. That’s just one of the hidden costs of unreliable electricity
@BillGates,Businessman,"Whenever I want to understand something better, I pick up a book."
@BillGates,Businessman,There is no question that reliable electricity unlocks a better life for people. But can we power the world without contributing to climate change? I think we can
@BillGates,Businessman,"Think back to the last time you experienced a power outage. If you live in New York, you don’t have to think that far back! Now imagine what it would be like not to have access to electricity at all. Nearly one billion people face that reality every day."
@BillGates,Businessman,"Five years ago, India was declared polio-free. This incredible milestone was made possible by the health workers, governments, partners, and donors who didn’t rest until every child was reached. I can’t wait to see what India achieves next."
@BillGates,Businessman,It's hard to overstate how important finding a better diagnostic is for fighting #Alzheimers. That’s why I’m investing in new ideas for easier and more accurate diagnosis of the disease.
@BillGates,Businessman,"I usually wait until the end of the year to share good news that you might have missed, but I couldn’t resist sharing this list from @PositiveNewsUK(check out #14!). Which story has inspired you the most so far this year?"
@BillGates,Businessman,Can you imagine an aircraft engine in your car? The @ARPAE.Summit is one of the coolest places to learn about new energy tech. The @btenergy team came back with lots of new ideas and insights from this year’s event.
@BillGates,Businessman,The people who will suffer most from climate change are the ones least responsible for it.
@BillGates,Businessman,What political and economic changes are needed to address climate change? 
@BillGates,Businessman,Last year @GatesUS invested $92 million in networks of schools that are working together to improve student outcomes. Here’s an update on the progress we’ve made in the first year of the program 
@BillGates,Businessman,I recently wrote about how people with tech skills can find fascinating problems to work on in global health and development. I was excited to come across this @techreview article about African machine learning researchers who are already doing just that.
@BillGates,Businessman,"Nearly one billion malaria cases have been prevented since 2000, but infection rates have plateaued or even increased in some areas. @axios explains how we can #StepUptheFight and end the disease for good."
@BillGates,Businessman,Nuclear power is the second-largest source of low-carbon electricity in the world — but its growth is slowing down. This important @IEA report outlines how countries can support existing reactors and advance nuclear innovation.
@BillGates,Businessman,"This is the teletype that brought Paul Allen and me together. And I’m so glad that it did. Paul was one of the most thoughtful, brilliant, and curious people I’ve ever met"
@BillGates,Businessman,"Today’s commitment by @theresa_may to #StepUpTheFight against AIDS, TB and malaria will help save millions of lives. @GlobalFund is one of the best investments the world can make in the years ahead"
@BillGates,Businessman,My friendship with Paul Allen changed my life. I loved sharing some of my favorite stories about him (and a few old photos!) at the Forbes Philanthropy Summit yesterday
@BillGates,Businessman,Few inventions have changed our lives as much as the battery. I’m excited that more inventors and investors are being attracted to the quest to build a better one.
@BillGates,Businessman,"it’s great to see such early support from Japan in re-committing to the @GlobalFund. The support of @AbeShinzo and the Japanese people will help the world #StepUpTheFight against AIDS, TB, and malaria."
@BillGates,Businessman,"I’m excited about the progress we’re making toward understanding Alzheimer’s. For the first time, @MIT researchers have completed an analysis of the genes that are expressed in individual brain cells of Alzheimer’s patients."
@BillGates,Businessman,"I learned what’s possible in agriculture from studying a remarkable scientist named Norman Borlaug. If you’re curious about Borlaug and his breakthroughs, I recommend this article and a book called “The Man Who Fed the World.”"
@BillGates,Businessman,"If you have the willingness to learn about a problem and the talent to help solve it, you can make a remarkable difference in the world."
@BillGates,Businessman,Fighting disease is like fighting fire. It’s not enough to put out most of it — you have to get it all.@Rotary’s generous pledge to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative will help us extinguish this terrible disease for good.
@BillGates,Businessman,"The fight against malaria is one of the greatest success stories in global health — but progress has slowed in recent years. To regain momentum, we must work together to combat drug and insecticide resistance."
@BillGates,Businessman,"I was moved by this story: Bob’s daughter has Down syndrome, which puts her at a higher risk for dementia. Motivated by her condition and his love of science, he volunteered for an #Alzheimers clinical trial."
@BillGates,Businessman,Our foundation’s Day of Caring is one of my dad’s favorite days of the year. I know he can’t wait to hear what our employees learn from our partners this year.
@BillGates,Businessman,"I’m always amazed by the disconnect between what we see in the news and the reality of the world around us. As my late friend Hans Rosling would say, we must fight the fear instinct that distorts our perspective"

@noumanbayyinah,Preacher,"Angels, while carrying Allah's Arsh, ask Allah to forgive us (40:7). Nothing  we do is important enough to overlook praying for each other."

@noumanbayyinah,Preacher,Some come to the Quran to seek benefit and others to seek criticism. Allah increases each in what they came for.
@noumanbayyinah,Preacher,The sign at a club in Trinidad tells you how you'll end up. Reminded me of the times Allah tells us to be upright.

@noumanbayyinah,Preacher,Trinidad is spectacular! SubhanAllah! The community is cool too bad! (That means too awesome apparently)

@noumanbayyinah,Preacher,Fixing your relationship with Allah necessitates fixing your relationships with those around you. Take initiative and take the first step.
@noumanbayyinah,Preacher,Don't give up on your Ramadan yet. If you've slacked off a bit it's ok. There's still lots of opportunity to make up for lost time.

@noumanbayyinah,Preacher,The death sentence passed down in Egypt is inhumane and unthinkable.
@noumanbayyinah,Preacher,"The more you SERIOUSLY study the Quran, the more it naturally humbles you. It's like at every turn you are reminded that you know nothing."
@noumanbayyinah,Preacher,"Insha Allah, khutbah today about , the incredible prayer of Musa AS before he embarked on his Divine mission."
@noumanbayyinah,Preacher,One of the saddest fallacies I've come to hear commonly is that the study of the Quran has already been exhausted.
@noumanbayyinah,Preacher,Bayyinah's mission is evolving. Soon we will be taking pioneering works in Quranic studies and simplifying them for mass consumption iA.
@noumanbayyinah,Preacher,"Every time I read the incredibly eloquent Arabic works of non Arab scholars, I'm left humbled at how little I know & how long the road is."
@noumanbayyinah,Preacher,Masjid Muhammad in Bermuda. May Allah bless this community for their love and hospitality.
@noumanbayyinah,Preacher,"As I travel around the world, I get more and more confirmation that the Quran brings hearts together like no human effort can."

@noumanbayyinah,Preacher,"Met a Christian fellow today on the street who asked me if I was Nouman from all the videos. May Allah ease peoples path to guidance, ameen."
@noumanbayyinah,Preacher,"When my mind is all over the place, nothing realigns me like a calm prayer."

@fluffyguy,Comedian,That stupid circle with the dot has been haunting me all day. Never had a problem til the day Funko came into my life.
@fluffyguy,Comedian,"Hey buddy, this site is getting slammed hard but I promise if there is a double charge we will take it off. Please give us a couple of days to let the smoke clear and let us know ur if u still have concerns"
@fluffyguy,Comedian,My site is not hating. It’s just overwhelmed like when I’m at @Sizzler_USA and I add salad bar plate to my meal. #FUNKOFluffy

@bgreene,Scientist,I am stunned and deeply saddened to learn that two colleagues—the brilliant physicists Ann Nelson and Steve Gubser—have died in unrelated accidents. Wonderful people and astoundingly creative thinkers. Such tragic losses.
@bgreene,Scientist,String Theory:  The basic idea in under 3 minutes.
@bgreene,Scientist," common misunderstanding: In quantum teleportation, matter is NOT teleported. Instead, quantum information describing matter is teleported. Which raises the question: Are you the sum of your information?"
@bgreene,Scientist,"The theory of relativity wraps errors...in magnificent mathematical garb ...like a beggar clothed in purple whom ignorant people take for a king.--Nikola Tesla, born OTD 1856. (Hey, nobody's perfect.)"
@bgreene,Scientist,"""Today's scientists have substituted mathematics for experiments, and they wander off through equation after equation, and eventually build a structure which has no relation to reality.""--Nikola Tesla, born OTD 1856."
@bgreene,Scientist,"“Biologically, physiologically, we are not so different from each other; historically, as narratives — we are each of us unique.”--Oliver Sacks, born OTD 1933."
@bgreene,Scientist,"Someday, surely, we will see the principle underlying existence as so simple, so beautiful, so obvious that we will all say to each other, Oh, how could we all have been so blind, so long!""""--John Archibald Wheeler, born OTD 1911."
@bgreene,Scientist,"OTD 1687, Isaac Newton publishes his Principia--perhaps the single most important scientific treatise of all time--forever changing our understanding of the universe."
@bgreene,Scientist,"The science behind the sparkle to round out your 4th of July festivities, courtesy of @WorldSciFest."
@bgreene,Scientist,"Today marks the end 7th anniversary of the profound discovery of the Higgs Boson by @CERN, completing the Standard Model of Particle Physics. That calls for fireworks."
@bgreene,Scientist,"In preparation for your Fourth of July. (My favorite: Fireworks that glitter, often created with antimony.)"
@bgreene,Scientist,"Can a quantum particle be at two locations? Better to say: A particle may not have a location at all. But when it does, it has only one (at least in this universe)."
@bgreene,Scientist,"""A man really dies when he loses the power to take in a new idea.""--George Orwell, born OTD, 1903."
@bgreene,Scientist,"Hold your thumb at arm's length against the night sky, and it will cover more than 10 million galaxies."
@bgreene,Scientist,"Actually, I mean more than just being a bystander or observer. I mean that you were truly part of that moment, a bona fide participant in the reality of that moment. Whatever you do in that moment, you have always done in that moment. Nothing will have changed."
@bgreene,Scientist,"Time travel to the past is probably impossible. But in the unlikely event that it is possible, the notion that moments in time are not changeable is one straightforward way to AVOID conclusions that are absurd."
@bgreene,Scientist,"Memory does indeed provide a kind of time machine, allowing us to revisit the past. But when I refer to time travel to the past, I'm referring to the far more crass version: not just remembering time past but going there."
@bgreene,Scientist,"If you could travel to the past, could you change anything? No. You could not change anything at all. You would have always been part of that time in the past. There are not two versions of  a moment, one without you and one with you. Moments in time just ARE. They don't change."

@bgreene,Scientist,"In about 500 million years, the moon will have receded too far from the Earth to block out the entire Sun. No more total solar eclipses."
@bgreene,Scientist,"The mystery at the core of quantum physics: How does the wavy, probabilistic haze transform into the single definite reality of experience?"
@bgreene,Scientist,"Human faculties do not directly experience the strangest features of the quantum world, but math allows us to grasp and explain it. That’s a powerful story and ranks among the greatest of achievements."
@bgreene,Scientist,An elegant formula that summarizes the geometry of space and time in @AlbertEinstein's Special Theory of Relativity.
@bgreene,Scientist,"The restriction that ""nothing can go faster than the speed of light"" refers to objects moving through space, not to the expansion of space itself."
@bgreene,Scientist,"Over any reasonable time frame, you are correct. Stars will burn out."
@bgreene,Scientist,"The shocking discovery, now more than 20 years ago, is that the expansion of space is speeding up, not slowing down. And, indeed, this is why distant galaxies may one day disappear from view."
@bgreene,Scientist,"Gravity as curved spacetime is a classical perspective. When we include quantum physics--which Einstein did not do and which physicists today are still working hard to fully achieve--we are led to a description of gravity that invokes particles of gravity, so-called gravitons."
@bgreene,Scientist,"Yes--we may be heading toward a future in which much of the universe we now have access to will race away too far and too fast for us to see it, regardless of the power of our telescopes. A kind of cosmic loneliness."
@bgreene,Scientist,"If you properly update the classical image of a block universe to include quantum mechanics, then yes. More precisely, with our current level of understanding, the universe--whether classical or quantum mechanical--appears to be deterministic."
@bgreene,Scientist,"Particles, as far as I know, don't know anything. They are mindless entities whose behavior is determined by nature's laws, expressed (in our most refined versions) as mathematical equations."
@bgreene,Scientist,The universe is big and getting bigger all the time. Light that started its journey shortly after the big bang but at a sufficiently large distance would not yet have had time to reach us.
@bgreene,Scientist,"As in LIGHT FALLS, Hilbert submitted his paper before Einstein, but no one is sure that his draft had the final form of the field equations. Conversely, no one knows if Einstein arrived at the equations fully on his own or if an early draft of Hilbert's paper offered guidance."
@bgreene,Scientist,Many thanks and much appreciated.
@bgreene,Scientist,"If you missed the PBS broadcast of LIGHT FALLS: Space, Time, and an Obsession of Einstein, watch it online until the end of the month. Celebrate one of humanity's greatest insights, and if you have any questions, ask away and I'll answer as many as I can."

@bgreene,Scientist,Dinner. At World Science Festival 2019. (Name that formula....)
@bgreene,Scientist,Celebrate the 100th anniversary of the confirmation of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. Light Falls. Tonight on PBS.
@bgreene,Scientist,Today marks the 100th anniversary of eclipse observations that confirmed Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. Here's a quick recap of this vital story:
@bgreene,Scientist,"Celebrate the 100th anniversary of the confirmation of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. Light Falls: Space, Time, and an Obsession of Einstein. Tomorrow on PBS."
@bgreene,Scientist,"It would be a spectacular triumph for CERN to produce a particle that might constitute the dark matter (like the WIMP you suggest). While possible, I consider this outcome to be unlikely."
@bgreene,Scientist,I do have a new book slated to be published this coming January (or so).
@bgreene,Scientist,"Yes--was also thinking of another episode (or two) to bring the NOVA miniseries, The Elegant Universe, up to date as well."
@bgreene,Scientist,"I have never updated The Elegant Universe, but am thinking I might do so for the -- gulip -- 25th anniversary edition, which would come out in 2024"
@bgreene,Scientist,"Give a deck of cards a good shuffle and it is virtually certain that the order of the cards has never previously been seen, at least not on planet earth."
@bgreene,Scientist,"Einstein, relativity, space, time: LIGHT FALLS. This Wednesday. PBS."
@bgreene,Scientist,"The United States ""should commit itself to...landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth,""--President John F. Kennedy, OTD 1961."
@bgreene,Scientist,One week from today: My new PBS special--LIGHT FALLS--celebrating the 100th anniversary of the confirmation of Einstein's General Relativity.
@bgreene,Scientist,"Thirty-five years after String Theory took physics by storm, we will explore the state-of-the-art in the quest for Einstein's dream of a unified theory. Join me and an array of leaders for a vibrant conversation. Tickets and information:"
@bgreene,Scientist,"""The principal source of the harm done by the State is the fact that power is its chief end.""--Bertrand Russell, born OTD 1872."
@bgreene,Scientist,"Roy Kerr, New Zealand mathematician who discovered the general relativistic geometry describing spacetime outside a rotating uncharged black hole, born OTD 1934. Here's the spacetime metric (all quite, ahem, intuitive)"
@bgreene,Scientist,Two weeks from today: My new PBS special--LIGHT FALLS--celebrating the 100th anniversary of the confirmation of Einstein's General Relativity.
@bgreene,Scientist,"""The imagination of nature is far, far greater than the imagination of man.""--Richard Feynman, born OTD 1918.."
@bgreene,Scientist,"Much as I venerate the name of Newton, I am not therefore obliged to believe that he was infallible.--Thomas Young, died OTD 1829, on showing that light is a wave. Subsequent discoveries proved that light is also a particle, vindicating Newton's view as well."
@bgreene,Scientist,"World Science Festival 2019: May 22 - June 2. Yours truly doing programs on General Relativity, String Theory, Dark Matter and the Nature of Time. If you are in NYC then, join us. See you there."
@bgreene,Scientist,"""The greatest deception men suffer is from their own opinions.""--Leonardo da Vinci, died OTD 1519."
@bgreene,Scientist,"There are problems to whose solution I would attach an infinitely greater importance than to those of mathematics, touching ethics or our relation to God, or concerning our destiny and our future.--Carl Friedrich Gauss, among the greatest of all mathematicians, born OTD 1777."
@bgreene,Scientist,"""Either mathematics is too big for the human mind, or the human mind is more than a machine.""--Kurt Gödel, one of the most influential logicians of all time, born OTD 1906."
@bgreene,Scientist,"The best that most of us can hope to achieve in physics is simply to misunderstand at a deeper level.--Wolfgang Pauli, born OTD 1900."
@bgreene,Scientist,"Max Planck, whose pioneering work on radiation emitted by bodies at a given temperature propelled science toward quantum mechanics, born OTD 1858. Here's his famous formula on black body radiation."
@bgreene,Scientist,"""Truth never triumphs—its opponents just die out.""--Max Planck, father of quantum mechanics, born OTD 1858."

@bgreene,Scientist,"""The more ignorant we become the less value we set on science.""--Thomas Jefferson, 3rd President of the United States, born OTD 1743."
@bgreene,Scientist,"It is hard to express how utterly remarkable and astoundingly delightful it is that mathematical scribblings can predict something as bizarre as black holes and then, looking to the skies with sufficient diligence, we find them."
@bgreene,Scientist,First-ever direct image of a black hole. Congratulations to the Event Horizon Telescope team.
@bgreene,Scientist,Event Horizon Telescope reveals first ever direct image of a black hole. Einstein's equations seem to triumph once again.
@bgreene,Scientist,"Tomorrow morning: Event Horizon Telescope reveals the first direct image of the edge of a black hole. Most exciting possibility: The image does not fully agree with the prediction from Einstein's general relativity, perhaps forcing us to modify Einstein's equations."
@bgreene,Scientist,"Excited for tomorrow's announcement from Event Horizon Telescope, likely providing first direct image of a black hole. Here's my recent conversation with project leader Shep Doeleman and astronomer Andrea Ghez, together with a brief primer on black holes."
@bgreene,Scientist,"""The monuments of wit survive the monuments of power.""--Sir Francis Bacon, died OTD 1626."
@bgreene,Scientist,A black hole with the mass of the sun exerts the SAME gravitational pull as the sun itself. The difference is that the black hole is much smaller in size and so you can get much closer to it. That's why you can experience a much greater gravitational pull.
@bgreene,Scientist,"If by ""thing"" you mean a viable theoretical framework for unifying the laws of nature, then yes, string theory is very much still a thing."
@bgreene,Scientist,"Happy 50th to Paul Rudd, a fellow traveler through the quantum realm."
@bgreene,Scientist,A solar mass black hole will likely not evaporate through Hawking radiation for another 10^68 years.
@bgreene,Scientist,"Actually, have been thinking about adding a fourth episode to The Elegant Universe Nova series, brining the discussion of string theory right up to date."
@bgreene,Scientist,"Hawking radiation is a mathematical consequence of general relativity and quantum mechanics. Our confidence in these two pillars of physics give us confidence in Hawking radiation, even without detecting it."
@bgreene,Scientist,"Hawking radiation has never been detected because the temperature of a typical black hole is miniscule. Using the formula, the Hawking temperature of a solar mass black hole is about 0.00000006 Kelvin."
@bgreene,Scientist,"Exciting News: On April 10 we may see the first ever close-up image of a black hole, courtesy the Event Horizon Telescope."
@bgreene,Scientist,Check out the wonderful new book by @stevenstrogatz bringing the insights of calculus--among the most important of all developments in the history of mathematics--to everyone.

@bgreene,Scientist,Happy #PiDay and happy birthday #AlbertEinstein. (Wonder if all those digits are actually correct...)
@bgreene,Scientist,"“I have looked further into space than ever human being did before me. I have observed stars of which the light, it can be proved, must take two million years to reach the earth.""--William Herschel"
@bgreene,Scientist,"Rest a flashlight on a ridiculously sensitive scale, turn it on, and watch the scale's reading as the light streams away. Light carries away energy, and since energy and mass are two sides of the same coin, the reading on the scale will decrease."
@bgreene,Scientist,Most spectacular quality of quantum mechanics: Two quantum entangled particles could be on opposite sides of the universe and yet they'd act as one.
@bgreene,Scientist,"Hans Christian Ørsted, who discovered an essential unity in nature's laws--the first connection between electricity and magnetism--died OTD 1851."
@bgreene,Scientist,Grasp a glass and you don't actually touch it. Electrons in your hand push against those in the glass creating a tiny but unbridgeable gap. Sit in a chair and you actually hover slightly above its surface. You've never had direct physical contact with anything.
@bgreene,Scientist,"We often say protons are made of 3 quarks, but that's a gross simplification. The 3 quarks contribute less than 1% of the proton's mass. The other 99% comes from a frothing sea of quantum fields that permeate the proton."
@bgreene,Scientist,"""What we know is not much. What we do not know is immense.""--Last words of mathematician/scientist Pierre-Simon Laplace, who died OTD 1827."
@bgreene,Scientist,"""Well, boys, we've been scooped.""--Robert Dicke, who died OTD 1997, upon hearing that Bell Labs researchers had unwittingly beaten his Princeton team to the first detection of radiation left over from the Big Bang."
@bgreene,Scientist,"George Gamow, an early pioneer of cosmological theory--who once attempted to defect from the Soviet Union by paddling across the Black Sea in a kayak stocked with coffee and chocolate--born OTD 1904"
@bgreene,Scientist,"From Einstein, we know that gravity is associated with warps and curves in the fabric of spacetime. In turn, that means gravity can generally traverse any spatial dimension. (There are subtle ways of trapping gravity too, but this is the basic idea.)"
@bgreene,Scientist,"In universes with extra dimensions, various forms of energy may be unable to travel through some of the dimensions. Electromagnetic energy (light) can be constrained to only move through certain dimensions, for example, while gravitational energy generally can travel through all. "
